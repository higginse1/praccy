                    <p>To find a local chapter in your area where you can donate blankets, volunteer your time, etc. just click on your state. All chapter coordinators and their contact information for that state will then be listed below the map.</p>
                    <h2>DONATING BLANKETS AND OTHER ITEMS</h2>
                    <p>The demand for blankets always exists and our chapter coordinators welcome finished blanket donations. However, your local chapter coordinator may need a particular blanket type more than others. You are highly encouraged to contact your local coordinator first to see what finished blanket types for which they have the greatest need.<br>
                    In addition to finished blankets, our coordinators may also need other items. For example, at chapter blanket making events there may be a need for fabrics, batting, thread, and other items. If you would like to donate something that can help your local chapter besides finished blankets, please contact your local chapter coordinator to see what supplies they need.</p>
                    <h2>BLANKET DROP-OFF SITES</h2>

We are working diligently to correct this problem and expect it to be rectified by Saturday, May 1, 2021. In the meantime please feel free to call and/or email your local chapter coordiantor for a drop off site near you.</p>

                    <p>We are always in need of your help to assist us in fulfilling our mission. You can donate home-made blankets by becoming a “blanketeer,” give of your time at a local chapter event, or even become a Chapter Coordinator yourself.</p>
                    <h2>BECOME A BLANKETEER</h2>
                    <p>Our volunteers, known as blanketeers, provide new handmade, washable blankets to be given as gifts to seriously ill and traumatized children, ages 0-18. It is Project Linus policy to accept blankets of all sizes, depending on local chapter needs. All blanket styles are welcome, including quilts, tied comforters, fleece blankets, crocheted or knitted afghans, and receiving blankets in child-friendly colors. Always remember that blankets must be new handmade, washable, free of pins, and come from smoke-free environments due to allergy reasons.<br><br>
